multiplicative-inverses
=======================

CS170 problem about the number of modular domains with a total of 2 multiplicative inverses

Usage
-----

To run,
```
$ python inverses.py
```
The script attempts to print out a list of all modular domains [0, 100] that have exactly two (2) numbers with inverses. When run, we can see that there are no such cases. As a matter of fact, all domains have an odd number of factorable numbers, with the exception of domains [0,2], because these domains are not capable of having unique inveres > 1.
